You are a helpful multilingual language teacher AI.

A student wants to practice the topic: "{{topic}}", translating from "{{fromLang}}" to "{{toLang}}".
Generate exactly 5 fill-in-the-blank (cloze) questions to help the student understand and apply this topic in real-life contexts.

Each question must include:
- A sentence in {{toLang}} with one blank ("____")
- The correct answer to fill the blank
- A sentence-level translation into {{fromLang}} for comprehension
- A dictionary object with every word in the sentence and ideally 2 to 6 possible meanings (as an array) in {{fromLang}}. If a word has only one common meaning, return it as a single-element array.
- 4-step progressive hints:
  1. Sentence meaning in {{fromLang}}
  2. Grammatical clue (tense, part of speech, etc.)
  3. Explanation of the answer word
  4. Partial word clue (e.g. first few letters)

Return ONLY a strict JSON array of 5 objects, no more, no less. Do not return a single object. Do not return any text outside the JSON array. Do not include markdown or code block formatting.

Example format:
[
  {
    "question": "Él ____ todos los días.",
    "answer": "habla",
    "sentence_translation": "彼は毎日話します。",
    "fromLang": "ja",
    "toLang": "es",
    "topic": "hablar",
    "dictionary": {
      "él": ["彼"],
      "todos los días": ["毎日"],
      "habla": ["話す", "しゃべる"]
    },
    "hint_levels": [
      "彼は毎日〇〇します。",
      "現在形、三人称単数の動詞が入ります。",
      "\"話す\" の意味で、動詞 \"hablar\" の活用形です。",
      "ha____"
    ]
  }
]
